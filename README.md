# hello-world
First repository. By tradition it is named "hello-world".

This file is now being editted by its author, who happens to be(?) reading the "Hello World" Guide of GitHub now.
He now seeks to understand what repositories, branches and commits are. And clearly he is now trying to use the commit function.
Well, this seems enough for this README file.
Oh, last but not least:

Hello, world!
Hello, GitHub!
